Transcription 1: How is momentum engaging the local political sphere? What kind of days in my local community are momentum supporting? What are the local campaigns that we should be thinking about locally and how are momentum creating media to have any say in those elections? What non-electoral political projects or campaigns are momentum involved in?
Transcription 2: I would like to inquire about what information you have about the 1952 riots in St Anne's, Musqueam. I'm building a project that is trying to re-educate people on the system and while also digitising records. So I'd also like to ask, are these records digitised at all?        
Transcription 3: As the largest gallery in Nottingham I feel like we lack any kind of political
Transcription 4: Testing, testing, one, two, three. It's me and T-Walk sitting in a tree.

As someone who's engaged in food production I was quite disappointed with how the produce, not produce, how the plants were being kept. It was showing that there was an opportunity for people and community to be getting involved in actually building a real herb garden. I feel like a lot of art spaces, and not including primary, are disengaged with the community and their issues or are engaged in allowing people in the community to express positive communal things. As someone else with young kids I'm unaware of the projects that you do to engage children that are of underage, to engage children from the community. What about racial and ecological justice? How many young people of colour or people from disenfranchised communities are you providing opportunities? While we're living in a crisis, what have you done as an organisation to provide any type of support to the community? Furthermore, Radford is a community that has been of the place, a sanctuary for many refugees for at least 30 years. How has your organisation been involved in that, in helping refugees get settled into the country as we see how the media and the government are spewing war against refugees?
